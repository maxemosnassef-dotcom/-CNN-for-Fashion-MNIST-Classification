# -CNN-for-Fashion-MNIST-Classification
Project ObjectiveThe primary goal of this project is to implement, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the multi-class classification task on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is designed to accurately recognize and categorize $28 \times 28$ grayscale images of various clothing items into one of 10 defined classes.
